# Concept
This is a concept of a private project to write a language learning helper using various local and or remote AI Models.

I primarily plan to use this to support my french learning journey in smart ways.

Planned features are:

  - Transcripe audios of various languages to text. (To reference for example listening comprehension audios or read along)
  - Generate SOTA Speech from Text (TTS) (For pronounciations that can't be found online)
  - Possibly use restrictions in already learned grammar and vocabulary to let Instruction / Chatmodel create example sentences to practice.
